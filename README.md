# API DOC 

We are using [apidoc](http://apidocjs.com) to generate the documentation
for this application.

To generate the api documentation, please install `npm install apidoc
-g` and run `apidoc -i ./ -o apidoc/`. A newly generated folder `/apidoc`
would be generated to illustrate the api

open the api through `/apidoc/index.html` in your browser

cheers, and have a :coffee: for the read
